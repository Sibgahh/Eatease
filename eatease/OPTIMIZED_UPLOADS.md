# Optimized Image Uploads for Firebase Free Tier

This document explains how the optimized image upload functionality works in the EatEase app, designed specifically to maximize the Firebase Free Tier storage limits.

## What's New

1. **Image Compression**: Before uploading, images are compressed to reduce file size while maintaining acceptable quality.
2. **Resolution Optimization**: Images are resized to 800x800 pixels, which is sufficient for most mobile display needs.
3. **Format Standardization**: All images are converted to JPEG format for better compression.
4. **Sequential Uploads**: Images are uploaded one at a time to prevent rate limiting issues.
5. **Smart Compression Levels**: Compression strength adjusts automatically based on the original file size.
6. **Progress Tracking**: Detailed progress tracking with batch upload status updates.

## Benefits for Free Tier

The Firebase free tier includes 5GB of storage and 1GB/day of downloads. These optimizations help you:

1. **Reduce Storage Consumption**: By compressing images, you can store more products with the same storage limit.
2. **Lower Download Bandwidth**: Smaller images mean less bandwidth used when customers view your products.
3. **Faster Uploads**: Compressed images upload faster, especially on slower connections.
4. **Better App Performance**: Optimized images load faster in your app, giving customers a better experience.

## How It Works

1. When you select an image, it's first analyzed for size.
2. Based on the size, an appropriate compression level is applied:
   - Large images (>1MB): Higher compression (60% quality)
   - Medium images: Standard compression (75% quality)
   - Small images (<100KB): Light compression (85% quality)
3. The image is also resized to 800x800 pixels maximum dimensions
4. The compressed image is saved temporarily and then uploaded
5. If compression doesn't reduce the size, the original is used instead

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues with image uploads:

1. **Use the Diagnostic Tool**: Click the question mark icon in the Product Form to run diagnostic tests.
2. **Check Your Connection**: A stable internet connection is required for uploads.
3. **Verify Firebase Rules**: Make sure your Firebase Storage rules allow authenticated uploads.
4. **Check File Types**: The app works best with standard image formats (JPEG, PNG).
5. **File Size Limits**: If an image is extremely large (>10MB), try selecting a smaller one.

## Technical Details

The implementation uses:
- `flutter_image_compress` for efficient image compression
- `path_provider` for temporary file management
- Firebase Storage for cloud storage
- Stream-based progress reporting
